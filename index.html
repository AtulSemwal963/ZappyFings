                <div class="gameDesc">Clicks Per Second Test is a motor ability test that requires you to click on a specified area as many times as you can for a certain period of time. It analyzes the ability of your muscles to not only work at a fast rate but also to maintain the same pace over a  duration of time. But be sure not to push yourself too hard as excessively working the same muscle can cause severe strains to the finger, wrists, or the entire foremarm as well.</div>
